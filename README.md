# Live Editor â€“ Real-Time Collaborative Code Editor

## Overview

**Live Editor** is a real-time collaborative code editing platform designed to improve developer productivity through synchronous collaboration. Built as part of a final-year BSc (Hons) Computer Science project at the University of Wolverhampton, this tool allows multiple users to join a virtual coding space ("room") and edit code simultaneously. The application aims to simulate a seamless, shared programming environment, addressing communication bottlenecks, streamlining code reviews, and enhancing team productivity.

This project also supports academic research into the effectiveness of real-time collaborative tools compared to traditional asynchronous workflows like Git-based version control.
